Draftulism - Twitter Drafts for NON-mobile
==========


What is it?
-----------
"Draftulism" is a little tool that will save your draft tweets on your computer, locally.
"Draftulism" let you save and delete your drafts and ofcourse, publish your saved drafts easily.


What is it NOT?
---------------
"Draftulism" is probably NOT the best way to do it but it works.
"Draftulism" is not syncronizing your different devices and does NOT loggs into your account.
No need for username or password.


Limitations
-----------
1.  "Draftulism" saves your drafts on the browser's local storage which its capacity is limited and this limitation varies by.
	The minimum that i'm aware of is 2.5 MB which is a LOTS OF TEXT.

2.  The local storage can be deleted by different softwares (e.g. ccleaner) or by the user, while deleting cookies or cache.
	Either way, keep that in mind and remember to exclude the local storage from cleaning.


How Does It Work?
-----------------
"Draftulism" is a simple bookmark (or bookmarklet).
A bookmarklet is a browser bookmark that instead of taking you to a certain web address, it runs a javascript code on the current page (on twitter in this case) and manipulates it.
So running "Draftulism" is as simple as clicking on a bookmark.
